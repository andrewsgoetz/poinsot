        <p>This animation simulates the motion of a torque-free top (shown in white), including "Poinsot's construction"
            with the invariable plane (yellow), momental ellipsoid (gray), polhode (magenta), and herpolhode (white). In
            this visualization the top is an ellipsoid, but any top with the same moments of inertia would have the same
            behavior. You can stop and reset the animation, at which point you can change the top's mass, shape, initial
            attitude, and initial angular momentum before starting the animation anew.</p>
        <p>The simulation is updated by numerically integrating the equations of motion using Euler's method. It's well
            known that Euler's method accumulates errors rather quickly, so if you watch long enough you will notice
            some wandering.</p>
